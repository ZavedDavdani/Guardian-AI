## 📌 Overview

During natural disasters and large-scale humanitarian crises, emergency response operations are severely hampered by information fragmentation. Distress calls and incident reports flood in simultaneously across voice calls, SMS, social channels, and messaging apps—often in unstructured formats, multiple regional languages, or colloquial code-switching.

At the same time, emergency responders, NGO field teams, and civil defense coordinators lack a unified operational picture. Critical hospital bed availability and ICU capacity fluctuate rapidly, duplicate reports overwhelm intake operators, and unverified rumors create dangerous logistical bottlenecks.

**GuardianAI** is an AI-assisted disaster-response coordination platform that unifies victim distress reporting, multi-agent intelligence extraction, semantic incident deduplication, capacity-aware hospital matching, and real-time operational command into an integrated workflow.

Powered by **LangGraph**, **FastAPI**, **ChatGroq (Llama 3.3 70B)**, **Ollama (`nomic-embed-text`)**, **Qdrant Vector Database**, and **React 19 + TypeScript**, GuardianAI demonstrates how specialized AI agents can collaborate in a deterministic stateful pipeline to assist human emergency coordinators with high-confidence decision support.

> [!NOTE]
> **Prototype Demonstration & Human-in-the-Loop Architecture**:
> GuardianAI is designed as an operational prototype and architectural reference. In live emergency management, automated AI recommendations serve solely as decision support for qualified human incident commanders. Real-world deployments require integration with official Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) systems, civil defense APIs (e.g., 112 / 911), and rigorous safety audits.

---

## 🚨 Problem

Emergency response operations during acute crises face several persistent operational breakdowns:

- **Fragmented & Unstructured Distress Reports**: Victims report emergencies through varied channels in informal, multilingual phrases (Hindi, Telugu, Urdu, English), often lacking precise coordinates or structured metadata.
- **Duplicate Report Storms**: Multiple individuals in the same neighborhood frequently report the identical incident (e.g., urban flooding or building fires), overwhelming dispatchers and obscuring the true geographic cluster boundaries.
- **Resource Mismatch & Hospital Overcrowding**: Injured victims are often routed to the nearest recognizable hospital without visibility into real-time ICU bed occupancy, available trauma specialists, or capacity limits, leading to dangerous triage bottlenecks.
- **Siloed Responder Agencies**: Police, fire brigades, medical personnel, volunteer groups, and NGOs operate with differing visibility requirements and permission boundaries, leading to conflicting coordination efforts.
- **Misinformation & Unverified Rumors**: Viral social media rumors regarding broken dams, closed shelters, or fake emergency hotlines induce public panic and misdirect scarce rescue assets.
- **Manual, High-Latency Workflow**: Triaging reports, looking up facility capacity, computing driving distances, and dispatching field teams manually introduces delays during the golden hour of disaster response.

1. **Multilingual Victim Intake**: Victims interact via a mobile-friendly conversational interface supporting text and voice dictation in English, Hindi, Telugu, Urdu, or transliterated vernacular.
2. **Deterministic Multi-Agent Coordination**: A sequential LangGraph `StateGraph` routes distress reports through four specialized agents, transforming raw narrative messages into validated operational incidents.
3. **High-Speed Semantic Deduplication**: High-dimensional vector embeddings generated by local Ollama instances (`nomic-embed-text`) are indexed in Qdrant, clustering incoming reports by geographic proximity and incident type.
4. **Capacity-Aware Hospital Allocation**: The system scores nearby hospitals based on Haversine distance, ICU availability percentage, total bed availability, and specialty matching (e.g., trauma, cardiac, orthopedic), proportionally distributing patients and updating live capacity.
5. **Real-Time Operational Command**: The unified incident payload is broadcast via WebSockets to the Responder Command Center, rendering live Leaflet maps, AI Action Plans with human-in-the-loop approval gates, misinformation tracking, and volunteer assignment.

## 🤖 AI / Multi-Agent System

GuardianAI implements a deterministic, multi-agent architecture orchestrated by **LangGraph** (`StateGraph`). Rather than relying on a single monolithic LLM prompt or an unconstrained conversational agent, GuardianAI divides emergency coordination into four modular, specialized agents connected by an explicit shared state object (`PipelineState`).

### 1. Victim Assistance Agent
- **Technology**: LangChain + `ChatGroq` (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, `temperature=0`)
- **Pipeline Node**: `intake_node`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Ingests raw, unstructured user distress messages in English, Hindi, Telugu, Urdu, or code-switched transliterations.
  - Extracts structured JSON entities: `location_text`, `need_type` (`fire`, `flood_rescue`, `medical`, `shelter`, `food`, `other`), `urgency` (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`), and `language_detected`.
  - Resolves geographic coordinates via local gazetteer lookups (`resolve_coordinates`).
  - Generates a calm, culturally attuned, reassuring response acknowledging report receipt and providing the nearest verified shelter location.

### 2. Emergency Intelligence Agent
- **Technology**: Ollama (`nomic-embed-text`, 768-dim embeddings) + Qdrant Client
- **Pipeline Node**: `dedup_node`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Constructs a weighted semantic query string (`f"{need_type} {need_type} incident at {location_text}"`) to ensure incident type weighting.
  - Computes 768-dimensional dense vector embeddings via local Ollama inference.
  - Performs cosine similarity vector search against the `guardian_incidents` collection in Qdrant.
  - Evaluates similarity scores against a strict threshold ($\ge 0.82$) combined with exact `need_type` verification.
  - Deduplicates incoming reports into an existing `incident_id` or provisions a new incident cluster, incrementing cluster size and estimated victim count ($\text{cluster\_size} \times 6$).
  - Computes calibrated confidence metrics and upserts the point structure into Qdrant.

### 3. Resource Finder Agent
- **Technology**: Deterministic Capacity-Aware Rules Engine & Geodesic Mathematics
- **Pipeline Node**: `match_node`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Calculates Haversine geodesic distances ($d_{\text{km}}$) between incident coordinates and regional hospitals.
  - Evaluates facility suitability using a multi-factor scoring function:
    $$\text{Score} = (\text{ICU Availability \%} \times 0.6) + (\text{Bed Availability \%} \times 0.3) + \text{Specialist Bonus}$$
  - Applies clinical specialty bonuses ($+0.15$ for trauma in fire/flood incidents, $+0.10$ for cardiac/general in medical emergencies, $+0.15$ for orthopedic).
  - Ranks candidate facilities and executes proportional victim distribution across the top 3 hospitals based on available bed shares.
  - Decrements live in-memory hospital capacity (`available_beds`, `icu_available`) to prevent duplicate over-allocation across concurrent incidents.
  - Synthesizes plain-language clinical reasoning statements (e.g., *"Hospital B ICU capacity moderate (57%)"*).

### 4. NGO Dashboard Agent
- **Technology**: Operational Synthesis & Role Dispatch Engine
- **Pipeline Node**: `dashboard_node`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Merges outputs from the Victim Assistance, Emergency Intelligence, and Resource Finder agents into a unified operational dispatch record.
  - Resolves appropriate responder agency roles (`medical`, `fire_brigade`, `ngo`, `disaster_management`) based on incident classification.
  - Assembles the complete incident payload containing action plans, reasoning justifications, confidence scores, victim counts, map coordinates, and ISO timestamps.
  - Formats the payload for broadcast over the WebSocket event stream to connected responder dashboards.

1. **Distress Submission**: A citizen submits a natural-language emergency message (e.g., *"i need help, water in my house, banjarahills"*) or records a voice note.
2. **Gateway Ingestion**: The client dispatches the request to FastAPI (`POST /api/pipeline/run`), initializing a `PipelineState` dictionary.
3. **Entity & Need Extraction**: The Victim Assistance Agent invokes Groq (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`) to extract location, urgency, and need classification, resolving spatial coordinates.
4. **Immediate Victim Feedback**: A reassuring confirmation message with the nearest relief shelter is generated and returned to the citizen interface.
5. **Vector Embedding Generation**: The Emergency Intelligence Agent invokes local Ollama (`nomic-embed-text`) to generate a 768-dimensional dense vector representing the incident.
6. **Vector Search & Deduplication**: The agent queries Qdrant to find existing incidents matching the location and need type ($\text{similarity} \ge 0.82$). If found, the report is merged into the cluster; otherwise, a new incident ID is created.
7. **Resource Optimization**: The Resource Finder Agent computes Haversine distances to regional hospitals, scores facilities on ICU availability and specialty fit, and allocates victim counts proportionally.
8. **Live Inventory Decrement**: The in-memory hospital capacity cache is updated immediately to reflect newly allocated beds.
9. **Operational Synthesis**: The NGO Dashboard Agent compiles the comprehensive operational payload with dispatch role tags and clinical reasoning.
10. **Live Dispatch & Command**: The FastAPI gateway broadcasts the incident via WebSockets (`/ws/dashboard`), immediately populating the Leaflet map and AI Action Plan panel for active responders.

## 🏗️ Architecture

![GuardianAI System Architecture](docs/architecture.png)

### Stage-by-Stage Architectural Breakdown

#### 1. Entry & Client Presentation Layer
Built with **React 19**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Leaflet**. The client layer provides dual specialized interfaces:
- **Victim Assistance Mobile Web App**: A lightweight, accessible conversational chat client featuring multilingual speech and text recognition, Web Speech API integration, and immediate shelter routing.
- **NGO & Responder Command Center**: A desktop-optimized operational workspace with dynamic role selection, real-time KPI metrics, interactive Leaflet mapping, expandable AI action plans, misinformation tracking, and volunteer management.

#### 2. API Gateway & Real-Time Communication Layer
Powered by **FastAPI** (`0.115.0`) and **Uvicorn**:
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Provides structured routes for victim message intake (`/api/victim`), responder role management and decision logging (`/api/responder`), hospital status querying (`/api/hospitals`), direct resource matching (`/api/resource`), and end-to-end pipeline execution (`/api/pipeline/run`).
- **WebSocket Broadcast Hub**: Implements an asynchronous `ConnectionManager` at `/ws/dashboard` maintaining persistent socket connections with active responder clients and broadcasting live incident updates.
- **Administrative Demo Controller**: Exposes `POST /api/admin/reset` to purge and recreate Qdrant vector collections and reset hospital capacity caches to baseline states for repeatable evaluations.

#### 3. LangGraph Multi-Agent Orchestration Engine
Built with **LangGraph** (`0.2.34`):
- Coordinates a sequential state machine (`StateGraph(PipelineState)`) managing four dedicated nodes: `intake` $\rightarrow$ `dedup` $\rightarrow$ `match` $\rightarrow$ `dashboard` $\rightarrow$ `END`.
- Preserves explicit typed state transitions across message extraction, vector deduplication, capacity-aware hospital matching, and responder payload formatting.

#### 4. Specialized Agent Pipeline
- **Victim Assistance Agent**: Communicates with **ChatGroq** (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`) to extract need categories, urgency, and place names while providing empathetic citizen reassurance.
- **Emergency Intelligence Agent**: Employs **Ollama** (`nomic-embed-text`) to generate 768-dimensional embeddings and queries **Qdrant** for spatial-semantic deduplication and cluster confidence estimation.
- **Resource Finder Agent**: Executes deterministic Haversine distance computations and multi-factor hospital suitability algorithms to balance patient loads and decrement live capacity.
- **NGO Dashboard Agent**: Synthesizes agent context into human-readable action plans with clinical reasoning and resolves responder role dispatching.

#### 5. Data & Vector Persistence Layer
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Relational schema defined via **SQLAlchemy 2.0** and **AsyncPG** storing `incidents`, `reports`, `hospitals`, and `users`.
- **Qdrant Vector Database**: High-speed vector index storing 768-dimensional incident vectors with cosine distance matching for rapid real-time similarity clustering.
- **Simulation & Seed Fixtures**: Pre-configured datasets (`mock_hospitals.json`, `seed_victim_reports.json`) and automated playback scripts (`seed_demo.py`) simulating live multi-incident disaster scenarios.

```

### Relational Schema (PostgreSQL)
- **`incidents`**: Stores consolidated emergency clusters (`id`, `type`, `area`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `victim_count`, `urgency`, `confidence`, `status`, `reasoning` JSON, `created_at`, `updated_at`).
- **`reports`**: Stores individual victim reports (`id`, `incident_id` FK, `raw_message`, `language`, `location_text`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `need_type`, `is_duplicate`, `created_at`).
- **`hospitals`**: Stores facility metadata (`id`, `name`, `area`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `total_beds`, `available_beds`, `icu_total`, `icu_available`, `specialists`).
- **`users`**: Stores user identities and access modes (`id`, `name`, `mode`, `role`).

### Vector Storage (Qdrant)
- **Collection Name**: `guardian_incidents` (with fallback to `victim_reports`).
- **Vector Specification**: 768-dimensional dense vectors generated by `nomic-embed-text`.
- **Distance Metric**: Cosine distance with a similarity threshold of $\ge 0.82$.
- **Payload Metadata**: `incident_id`, `location_text`, `need_type`, `cluster_size`, `timestamp`.

### Simulation Data Fixtures
- **`mock_hospitals.json`**: Pre-configured facility roster for 4 major Hyderabad healthcare institutions (Hospital A - Ameerpet, Hospital B - Secunderabad, Hospital C - Banjara Hills, Hospital D - Kukatpally) with detailed bed counts, ICU capacity, and specialist tags.
- **`seed_victim_reports.json`**: 18 multilingual distress messages representing diverse disaster situations (flooding, fires, rooftop strandings, chest pain, structural collapses).

---

## ⚡ Real-Time Operations

GuardianAI implements a real-time event pipeline using native WebSockets:

1. **Persistent Connection**: When a responder opens the Command Center, the frontend hook `useWebSocket` establishes a persistent connection to `/ws/dashboard`.
2. **Connection Heartbeat**: The client sends periodic keep-alive pings every 15 seconds to prevent timeout disconnections across firewalls and reverse proxies.
3. **Pipeline Broadcast**: Whenever a new emergency report is processed via `/api/pipeline/run`, the LangGraph orchestrator produces an aggregated action plan. The FastAPI router immediately invokes `manager.broadcast({"type": "incident_update", "payload": final})`.
4. **Reactive State Mutation**: The frontend listener catches the `incident_update` event, smoothly updating active incident lists, recalculating top-level KPI counters, repainting Leaflet map markers, and populating the AI Action Plan panel without full-page reloads.

---

## 🐳 Docker & Containerization

GuardianAI is container-ready. The backend includes a dedicated `Dockerfile` for containerized Python execution, and the architecture is designed to orchestrate the application alongside PostgreSQL and Qdrant via Docker Compose.

```yaml
# Conceptual Multi-Service Architecture
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@db:5432/guardian_db
      - QDRANT_HOST=qdrant
      - GROQ_API_KEY=${GROQ_API_KEY}
    depends_on:
      - db
      - qdrant

  db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=guardian_db
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres

  qdrant:
    image: qdrant/qdrant:latest
    ports:
      - "6333:6333"
```

> [!NOTE]
> For local development, running FastAPI directly with Uvicorn alongside local Qdrant and PostgreSQL provides the lowest-latency debugging loop for LLM prompts and Ollama embedding generation.

## 🛡️ Security & Responsible AI Use

Because GuardianAI addresses emergency response and humanitarian crisis workflows, safety, data protection, and operational reliability are foundational design considerations:

- **Prototype & Decision Support Scope**: GuardianAI is an engineering prototype and research system. AI outputs, hospital allocations, and incident clusters must never replace human judgement in life-or-death situations.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Safeguards**: The system enforces explicit **Approve Plan** and **Override** controls for emergency coordinators before dispatches are logged.
- **Data Privacy & PII Handling**: Distress reports contain sensitive location and medical details. In production environments, victim phone numbers and direct identifiers must be pseudonymized, and data in transit must be encrypted via TLS 1.3.
- **Auditing & Traceability**: All responder overrides and dispatch decisions are logged with timestamps to provide an immutable operational audit trail for post-incident review.
- **Graceful Degradation**: If vector databases or external LLMs become unreachable, the backend maintains fallback responses and local gazetteer coordinate lookups to prevent system deadlocks.

---

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

- **Simulated Demonstration Fixtures**: Hospital occupancy metrics and seed distress reports are derived from realistic mock data for Hyderabad rather than live government telemetry.
- **Gazetteer-Based Geocoding**: Coordinate resolution currently relies on a regional gazetteer lookup dictionary for Hyderabad localities rather than a live global geocoding service (e.g., Google Maps / Mapbox / OpenStreetMap Nominatim).
- **Prototype Authentication Gate**: The user and responder role selection is implemented as an in-memory client toggle for rapid demonstration rather than full OAuth2/SAML SSO authentication.
- **Local Ollama Dependency**: Semantic deduplication requires a running local Ollama instance with `nomic-embed-text` or a self-hosted embedding server.
- **No Direct CAD / Emergency Telephony Bridge**: The platform does not directly initiate PSTN phone calls, SMS broadcasts, or interface directly with national emergency dispatch lines (e.g., 112).

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- **Live CAD & 112 Integration**: Direct two-way synchronization with official Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) systems and national emergency response gateways.
- **Satellite & GIS Flood Modeling**: Ingestion of real-time satellite radar imagery (ISRO / Sentinel) and rainfall telemetry to overlay dynamic flood inundation polygons onto the Leaflet map.
- **HL7 / FHIR Hospital Capacity Sync**: Direct integration with regional hospital management information systems (HMIS) for live bed, ventilator, and blood bank availability.
- **Production RBAC & Audit Trails**: Hardened JWT/OAuth2 session authentication with multi-factor verification and cryptographic immutable logging.
- **Offline-First PWA & SMS Gateway**: Progressive Web App caching and two-way SMS emergency reporting for citizens in low-bandwidth or infrastructure-damaged disaster zones.
- **AI Voice Call-In Agent**: Real-time voice agent integration (via Twilio WebRTC / LiveKit) allowing victims to dial a single emergency number and speak naturally with the intake agent.

---

## 💡 Why GuardianAI?

GuardianAI demonstrates practical, high-impact AI systems engineering applied to disaster management:

- **LangGraph Multi-Agent State Machine**: Showcases how to move beyond simple chat interfaces into robust, deterministic multi-agent pipelines with explicit state transitions and typed contracts.
- **Hybrid Spatial-Semantic Clustering**: Combines 768-dimensional dense vector embeddings in Qdrant with geographic gazetteer mapping to solve the real-world duplicate report problem during emergencies.
- **Resource Optimization Algorithms**: Demonstrates domain-grounded mathematical optimization combining Haversine distance, ICU availability, clinical specialty weighting, and live inventory decrementing.
- **Real-Time Reactive Architecture**: Unifies asynchronous FastAPI backends with WebSocket dispatch and modern React 19 frontend state management for zero-latency situational awareness.
- **Social Impact AI**: Applies advanced LLM reasoning, multilingual NLP, and vector search to address critical humanitarian coordination challenges.
